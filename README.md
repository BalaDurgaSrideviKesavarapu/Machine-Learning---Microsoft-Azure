# Machine-Learning---Microsoft-Azure
Azure has the most user-friendly cognitive application development environment. We take a look at how some of the cognitive technologies currently offered by Microsoft Azure are implemented into the formation of a cognitive based app developed to recommend movies based on a movie previously seen by the user. This app uses a “Match Box Recommender” Machine Learning method to solve the problem of assisting people with making decisions; in this case, deciding on what movie to watch next based on the app’s suggestion. We have developed the app from a simplistic standpoint, but we discuss improvements that would need to be made in order to improve accuracy and to increase user friendliness. These improvements discussed are based on our own observations and the feedback from others that have tested the application. The development process for this app follows a basic flow pattern of selecting our data sample to use, splitting the data for training, training process, scoring process, and then evaluating the app. Step-by-step tutorial is provided at the end of this report.
